## Abstract
This is a small library management service.


## License
The license for the software is GPL 3.0 or newer. Parts of the software may be licensed under other licences like MIT
or Apache 2.0 - the files are marked appropriately. 

The kp-library-api and kp-library-client is also co-licensed on LGPL 3.0 or newer.

Some javadoc documentation contains information from https://www.wikipedia.org(Wikipedia).

## Architecture

tl;dr (ok, only the bullshit bingo words):
- Immutable Objects (where frameworks allow)
- Relying heavily on generated code
- 100 % test coverage of human generated code
- Every line of code not written is bug free!

Code test coverage for human generated code should be 100%, machine generated code is considered bug free until proven
wrong. Every line that needs not be written is a bug free line without need to test it. So aim for not writing code.


## Distribution
There is no distribution of this software. You need to build it from the sources.


## Note from the author
This software is meant do be perfected not finished.

If someone is interested in getting it faster, we may team up. I'm open for that. But be warned: I want to do it 
_right_. So no shortcuts to get faster. And be prepared for some basic discussions about the architecture or software 
design :-).
